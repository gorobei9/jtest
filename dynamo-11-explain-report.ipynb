    "* Any computation (even a simple read of a constant value) may declare it has footnotes\n",

    "Footnoting is based on a number of observations about large software systems (say, 1M LOC or more):\n",
    "* Any complex report (i.e. computation output) will generally be somewhat wrong, misleading, or out of date.\n",
    "* If you want 100% correctness and truth, your report will raise an exception every time you run it.\n",
    "* If you just want it to run, you'll get a result, but some log file on some machine in some compute farm will have a message explaining why your result is wrong.\n",
    "* And you won't see that message.\n",
    "* And that message may have leaked information that bad actors can read.\n",
    "* And you won't trust this system, so your own developers will copy the underlying data and write their own version of the report with all the same issues.\n",
