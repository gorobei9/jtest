# jtest - a resposity of random notebooks

## MAND

The abstract nonsense database.

1. **dynamo-3**. Experimental code that should explain the basic structure & components of the db/system
2. **dynamo-4**. As above, but with code refactoring into the mand library.
3. **dynamo-5-greeks**. Numerical derivatives example. Mostly a POC for demonstrating Contexts.
4. **dynamo-6-portfolios**. Aggregating workbooks into trees.
5. **dynamo-7-FRED**. A POC app that fetches, stores, and displays Federal Reserve data.
6. **dynamo-8-profiling**. First cut at a profiling tool that shows call counts & times in the mand client.
7. **dynamo-9-FRED-sanity-checks**. Quick test that the FRED foreign exchange data roughly corresponds to reality.
8. **dynamo-10-positions**. A POC accounting & front-office trading system. Demos a few bi-temporal reports (risk, PnL, prior day amends.)
9. **dynamo-11-explain-report**. A POC of a serious PnL explain report.
10. **dynamo-12-dependencies**. Experimental code that demos the idea of computed value reuse using context simplification.
11. **dynamo-13-odds-and-ends**. Various sanity checks.
