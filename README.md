## mand

The abstract nonsense database.

1. **dynamo-3**. Experiemntal code that should explain the basic structure & components of the db/system
2. **dynamo-4**. So above, but with code refactoring into the mand library.
3. **dynamo-5-greeks**. Numerical derivatives example. Mostly a POC for demonstrating Contexts.
