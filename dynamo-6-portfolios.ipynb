    "* Portfolios are a tree structure: a portfolio can contain multiple books or other portfolios.\n",
    "* A portfolio should have the same API as a single book, specifically: the tickets in a book are the set of tickets in\n",
    "the underlying books, the workItems in a portfolio are the net of the workItems in the underlying books.\n",
    "* Books can appear in multiple portfolios: the books hold activity, each portfolio is a view useful to somebody \n",
    "(e.g. a manager.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An real-world example might be a helpdesk with a group of workbooks, for example:\n",
